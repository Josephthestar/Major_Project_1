# Major_Project_1

how i started my project(My Approach)

the first step is that i started by asking myself how do i want the layout to look for the main page,

haaving to do some mental imagination i finally was able to start tackling the biggest chunk of work in my opinion which was the navigation bar hence(the cheeseburger icon) that some may refer to or know it as!!!

2-after understandting how i wanted the layout for the main page to look i then started to tackle each component sepertly .

the components are as follow for each function
1-the Navigation Bar
2-(x) to close out the menue
3-navigation menue drop down
4-random image wallpaper background change by clicking the icon button

describing what each function does

1-when a user clicks on the navi bar,the following menu directory appears from the screen or menu drop down.

2-when hovering over a icon or symbol their would be a litttle animation to change the navigation bar 
from the cheeseburger to a x by simply hovering over it 

3-after clicking on the nav icon,a black dropdown menue with a black background with the seleceted dropdown list is
availible to choose from 

the random image wallpaper was easy to input into my website for the main page.however some issues that i have are as follow
1-when the main page loads,their is no background wallpaper,a user must click on the change wallpaper icon to generate a random image wallpaper. a futre update is that i will add the feature to start when a main wallpaper so its not blank when clicking on the page.

functin explaining done

once i was able to achieve these functions it was quit straight forward by plug and chug by linking the following index files to each associate word description.


Technical Demonstration
All projects will be presented to the class. Your presentation should:

Be approximately 5 minutes in length. Consider practicing your presentation beforehand.
Show off all features of the app itself.

Explain the technical details.
What is the technical requirement specification? A technical requirement specification document for a website or other software product defines its purpose, functionalities, and behavior. In other words, it defines what the website is for, what it should do, and how.

Explain the technical details.
[jquery and css were the 2 main technical issues i faced while coding my website,so i utilized them both alot to really make my websie work]
the reasources that help were wer w3-school link below
Explain the technical challenges.

Explain which improvements you might make in the future.

explainging 
the Creativity *
Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?at this time,no but i will be able to in the futre.the goal was to meet the project guidlines to copletation and i meet them.
Did you deliver something of value to the end user? no but will update in the futre sice this is still a personal website.

Code Quality *
Did you follow code style guidance and best practices such as indentation and semantic naming?
to my best of ability,yes
Did you comment your code? absolutly so i dont waist time thinkking what each lne does,lets save the 247 hours.

Problem Solving *
Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? yes to a beginner level degree

Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? theirs defintly alternate solutions or ways how one website code can be,but for me i wanted to reach my objective utilizing the basics concepts and building my knowledge from their.

the last part was simply inserting my information through each created  index website that i used to organize with boxes to keep it simple for me.each box can be re-shaped to any desired need.in my case,small but easy to read.
using the href link approach.
